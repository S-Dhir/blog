    <p>We are surrounded by computers. There is at least one in every middle-class house. Except for those who are already buying one. If you are choosing between a computer. Be it desktop or laptop, then this is the right article for you! Or even if you don’t really see the use of a computer. </p>
    <h2>What is a computer?</h2>
    <p>A computer is a machine. It mainly does calculations. It consists of a few parts that might seem complicated at start but you’ll learn it in a few days if you put in the effort. A computer has many different looks and designs. Here are some of the basic ones: </p>
    <img src="images/mobile.jpg" alt="mobile" class="blog_images">
    <p>A mobile phone (Yes this is also a computer. Over the years people have called laptops and desktops computers forgetting that mobile phones are also computers.)</p>
    <img src="images/Laptop.png" alt="laptop" class="blog_images">
    <p>Laptops</p>
    <img src="images/desktop.png" alt="desktop" class="blog_images">
    <p>Desktop</p>
    <img src="images/servers.png" alt="servers" class="blog_images">
    <p>Servers</p> <br>
    <h2>So, what do they do?</h2>
    <p>
        Oh, what these computers? Well, their main purpose is to do calculations faster than a human can. But, some people have taken this to the next level. Now they not only do a bunch of multiplication sums but, they are useful for making video games, video editing, animation, typing. Pretty much anything. You ever seen those kids stuck on to gadgets all day? That’s because these computers can do so much advanced calculations that they can show awesome stuff. Like games. 
    </p>
    <h2>Tell me more about these</h2>
    <p>
        Sure! Here’s a few basic facts,
        <br>
        You would want to note that all computers are not as powerful as each other. For example, mobile phones can do less when compared to a server. A server may be able to do what 100 mobile phones can’t do! This means that say, you want a device that will be able to manage all the Whatsapp messages on earth. This means that it receives all messages that someone sends and then forwards it to the people who should receive the message. So let’s say person A sends a message to person B. What the device A will do is send you information like, the message, the name of the person and that this message is to be delivered to person B. If this is a mobile phone that is doing this then, one message it will be able to send. It will receive, run a programme, which will forward the message almost instantly after receiving. But imagine if 2 Billion messages were sent to this mobile at the same time. All are being sent to different people, all have different messages, and some even have files with them. A very powerful computer will be needed to handle so much. Or else, if you use your mobile for this, then the phone will shut down due to heavy load. Or worse could happen. With the heat that will be generated, the phone could burn. Below, I have listed some pointers specific to every computer that I have mentioned.
